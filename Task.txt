We have a Node.js application with three types of users: Admin, Blogger, and User. Each user type has specific permissions and roles as described below:

User

Can add comments on blogs.
Blogger

Can add new blogs.
Can edit their own blogs.
Admin

Can delete comments made by users.
Can add new blogs.
Can delete any blogs.
Can update blogs written by bloggers.
Our goal is to implement the following functionality:

Ensure that only users with the appropriate roles can perform their respective actions.
Properly manage permissions to maintain a secure and organized environment.
Implementing these functionalities will involve setting up role-based access control within the Node.js application. This will ensure that each user type can only perform actions allowed by their roles.
